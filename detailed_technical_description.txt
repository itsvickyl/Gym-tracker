# Detailed Technical Description of the Streamlit Application for Pose Detection

## 1. Imports and Dependencies

The script begins by importing several crucial libraries that are essential for its functionality:

### Streamlit
Streamlit is a powerful framework for creating interactive web applications. In this script, it is used to build the user interface, allowing users to interact with the application, view real-time video feeds, and see pose detection results. The import statement is:
```python
import streamlit as st
```

### OpenCV
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a widely used library for computer vision tasks. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for image and video processing, including capabilities for capturing video from a webcam. The import statement is:
```python
import cv2
```

### Mediapipe
Mediapipe is a framework developed by Google for building multimodal machine learning pipelines. In this script, Mediapipe is used for pose detection, allowing the application to detect and track human poses in real-time. The relevant import statements are:
```python
import mediapipe as mp
```

### NumPy
NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for large multidimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. The import statement is:
```python
import numpy as np
```

## 2. Initialization

After importing the necessary libraries, the script initializes several Mediapipe and OpenCV modules:

### Mediapipe Drawing Utils and Pose
Mediapipe provides tools for drawing detected landmarks and models for various tasks, including pose detection. In this script:
```python
mp_drawing = mp.solutions.drawing_utils
mp_pose = mp.solutions.pose
```
- `mp_drawing`: This module is used to draw landmarks and connections on the images, making it easier to visualize the detected poses.
- `mp_pose`: This module provides the pose detection model, which is used to identify and track body landmarks.

## 3. Functions

The script defines several functions to handle various tasks. Each function is crucial for processing the video frames, detecting poses, and updating the user interface.

### Function to Calculate Angle
This function calculates the angle between three points. It is essential for determining the position of body parts, which is used to track exercises and repetitions. The function can be described as follows:
```python
def calculate_angle(a, b, c):
    a = np.array(a)
    b = np.array(b)
    c = np.array(c)
    
    radians = np.arctan2(c[1] - b[1], c[0] - b[0]) - np.arctan2(a[1] - b[1], a[0] - b[0])
    angle = np.abs(radians * 180.0 / np.pi)
    
    if angle > 180.0:
        angle = 360 - angle
        
    return angle
```
- **Parameters**: Points `a`, `b`, and `c` are the coordinates of the joints.
- **Returns**: The calculated angle between the points.

### Function to Perform Pose Detection
This function uses the Mediapipe pose detection model to detect poses in a given video frame and returns the landmarks:
```python
def detect_pose(image, pose):
    image_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    results = pose.process(image_rgb)
    return results.pose_landmarks
```
- **Parameters**: `image` is the video frame, `pose` is the Mediapipe pose model.
- **Returns**: Detected pose landmarks.

### Function to Draw Landmarks
This function draws the detected landmarks on the video frame for visualization:
```python
def draw_landmarks(image, landmarks):
    mp_drawing.draw_landmarks(
        image, 
        landmarks, 
        mp_pose.POSE_CONNECTIONS,
        mp_drawing.DrawingSpec(color=(245, 117, 66), thickness=2, circle_radius=2),
        mp_drawing.DrawingSpec(color=(245, 66, 230), thickness=2, circle_radius=2)
    )
```
- **Parameters**: `image` is the video frame, `landmarks` are the detected pose landmarks.

### Function to Calculate Repetitions
This function tracks the number of repetitions of a particular exercise based on the angles calculated:
```python
def count_reps(angle, counter, stage):
    if angle > 160:
        stage = "down"
    if angle < 30 and stage == 'down':
        stage = "up"
        counter += 1
    return counter, stage
```
- **Parameters**: `angle` is the current angle of the joint, `counter` tracks the number of repetitions, `stage` indicates the current stage of the exercise.
- **Returns**: Updated counter and stage.

## 4. Main Execution Logic

The main part of the script sets up the Streamlit application. It defines the layout, captures video frames, and processes them for pose detection.

### Streamlit Layout
The layout of the Streamlit app includes headers, text inputs, and buttons. Users can interact with the application, upload videos, and view the results of pose detection:
```python
st.title("Pose Detection App")
st.header("Real-time pose detection using Mediapipe and OpenCV")

uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose a video...", type=["mp4", "mov", "avi"])
if uploaded_file is not None:
    video = uploaded_file.read()
    # Further processing of the uploaded video
```
- **Title and Header**: The title and header set up the basic UI.
- **File Uploader**: Allows users to upload a video file for processing.

### Pose Detection and Visualization
Video frames are captured using OpenCV, and each frame is passed to the pose detection function. Detected poses are drawn on the frame and displayed in the Streamlit app. Repetition count and other metrics are updated and displayed:
```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Use webcam

while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    
    # Perform pose detection
    landmarks = detect_pose(frame, mp_pose.Pose())
    
    if landmarks:
        draw_landmarks(frame, landmarks)
    
    # Display frame
    st.image(frame, channels="BGR")
```
- **Video Capture**: Captures frames from the webcam.
- **Pose Detection**: Detects and draws pose landmarks on each frame.
- **Display**: Displays the processed frame in the Streamlit app.

## 5. Dataset Information

Although the script primarily processes real-time video input, it can also handle predefined video files or streams. The expected inputs are video frames captured via a webcam or uploaded video files. The application processes these inputs to detect and visualize human poses, providing users with real-time feedback on their movements.

### Example Data Flow
1. **Input**: Video frames from webcam or uploaded video file.
2. **Processing**: Pose detection using Mediapipe, angle calculation, repetition counting.
3. **Output**: Visualized poses on the video frame, displayed in Streamlit app, with real-time updates on repetitions and other metrics.
